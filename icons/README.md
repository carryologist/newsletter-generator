# Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

For now, you can use any simple newsletter/document icon images.
The extension will work without these icons, but they improve the user experience.

Recommended design: Simple "N" letter or newsletter/document symbol in blue (#3b82f6) on white background.
